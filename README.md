🚀 Bridging AI & Drug Repurposing: Unlocking New Possibilities 🧬💊

In the ever-evolving landscape of AI and healthcare, I'm working on an MVP that connects a SwiftUI frontend with a Flask-based Python backend powered by DeepSeek 7B (via Ollama) to facilitate rare disease queries and drug repurposing insights.

🔍 The Goal?

To harness reasoning LLMs for drug repurposing insights by integrating public biomedical datasets and leveraging LLM-powered retrieval to assist medical professionals and researchers in accelerating discoveries.

💡 Key Data Sources:

📌 Drug Information – DrugBank, PubChem, ChEMBL, RxNorm
 📌 Target & Pathways – UniProt, KEGG, Reactome, Human Protein Atlas
 📌 Disease Insights – OMIM, MeSH, ICD-10, DisGeNET
 📌 Clinical Trials & Literature – ClinicalTrials.gov, PubMed, Google Scholar

⚡ Why This Matters?

Drug discovery is expensive & time-consuming. By utilizing LLMs with Test-Time Compute, we can:

 ✅ Fast-track insights & hypothesis generation
 ✅ Uncover new therapeutic uses
 ✅ Enable data-driven decision-making for researchers

🔭 Future Directions: Expanding AI’s Role in Drug Repurposing

🤖 AI Agents for Data Collection & Thinking

Automated biomedical data gathering from structured (databases, APIs) and unstructured (papers, patents) sources.
Multi-agent collaboration: Specialized retrieval agents, reasoning agents, and verification agents working in tandem.

🧠 Co-Researcher AI Agents

AI-powered co-researchers that simulate expert reasoning, suggest hypotheses, and validate findings.
Multi-modal LLMs to integrate text, molecular structures, and clinical data.

⚙️ Advancing Retrieval & Reasoning

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Enhancing LLMs with real-time access to biomedical literature & trials.
GraphRAG: Leveraging knowledge graphs for a structured, explainable approach to drug repurposing.
Dynamic Test-Time Compute Reasoning: Using LLMs not just for retrieval but for complex biomedical inference at runtime.

🎯 The Tech Stack:

🖥️ Frontend: SwiftUI for a clean, intuitive UX
 ⚙️ Backend: Flask API with RESTful endpoints & CORS
 🧠 AI Model: DeepSeek 7B for reasoning-driven biomedical queries
 🔍 Data Processing: RAG, GraphRAG, and multi-agent workflows

By bridging LLM reasoning, real-time retrieval, and multi-agent collaboration, we’re pushing drug repurposing & biomedical research into a new era of AI-driven discovery. 🚀🔬
